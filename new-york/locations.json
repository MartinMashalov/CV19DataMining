We also ask that participants utilize their golf cart, if available, when visiting the testing site.\n\nUnfortunately, test kits and supplies are limited due to resource issues at the state and national levels. As a result, we can only offer a limited number of testing appointments each day.\n\nAnswers to your questions below will help us determine which arm of testing you would be eligible for and will direct you to the appropriate scheduling page where you can sign up for a test appointment assuming testing supplies are available.\n\nPlease note that appointments for testing will be released 1 day in advance - with all test slots for the next day coming online each morning at 8 AM, so if testing slots are no longer available today, you will have an opportunity to sign up for a slot again tomorrow.\n\n***Test slots are allocated to those who sign up first.***","updated":"2020-04-04","featured":"TRUE"}]
