    "description": "Houston-area free testing began Thursday, March 19, nearly a week after Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced it would begin. Dr. Joe Varon with the United Memorial Medical Center explained the process to get tested at a press conference. He says it takes about four to 24 hours to get the results.\n\nOnce you come to see us, you will go through a brief screening. If we believe that you need to be tested, you will go through a registration department, and have a very easy nasal/swab test that will take a few minutes to do,\" Varon said. \"If you are coming to us because you think you have COVID-19, you need to be isolated for a minimum of 14 days.\"",
