	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>This is an effort to crowdsource the availability of Corona / COVID-19 virus testing locations arcross all 50 states, using a handful of freely available online tools. Cetralizing the crowdsourcing of testing locations into one data source while using APIs to make sure the data can be syndicated across many locations.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Google Sheets</strong> - (<a href="{{ site.google_sheet_html_url }}" target="_blank">Sheet</a>) - The core data for this project is storied in a single Google Sheet for each U.S. state, providing a central data source that can be managed by multiple trusted stakeholders.</li>
		<li><strong>Postman</strong> - (<a href="{{ site.postman_collection_url }}" target="_blank">Collection</a>) (<a href="{{ site.postman_documentation_url }}" target="_blank">Docs</a>) - Data is pulled from Google using the Google Sheets API and then updates an API, documentation, and publishes data to GitHub for further display to end users.
		<li><strong>GitHub</strong> - (<a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_org }}/{{ site.github_repo }}" target="_blank">Repo</a>) - This website is hosted using GitHub using their GitHub pages service, using data originating within Google Sheets, and made available via Postman APIs, to display a listing of locations.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The purpose of This project is to provide a lightweight, easy to use, centralized, and distributed approach to crowdsourcing testing locations as they pop up across 50 states. Using proven services to aggregate, manage, and make virus testing locations easier to find.</p>
