    "description": "AllCare is offering telemedicine consults for patients who think they might have the coronavirus, followed by drive-through testing at certain locations.\n\nYou can schedule a video appointment here. The testing is done through your car window by a medical professional using a nasal or oral swab to take a sample for testing.\n\nMost insurers cover the test under a national emergency plan, AllCare says, but if you're uninsured, it will cost $206, which includes both the telemedicine consult and the testing. Results come back in 3 to 4 days, and you can receive them via text and email.",
